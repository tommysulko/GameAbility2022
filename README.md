# Idea

Our idea was to rehabilitate those who are partially paralyzed making them play. To create the game we used Unity while to try to move the ball through the movement of the wrist useful for rehabilitation we used Openpose, a program capable of detecting body movements.

# Menù

For the menu we have added an image as a background and we have added two buttons on for the Start and one for exit.

# Obstacles

For each level we have decided to insert obstacles based on the difficulty of the level, which if hit return to the beginning of the level.

Examples:

# Goal

To change the level when you win we used this square as a goal at the end of each level

# Textures

We used textures to apply to the objects and backgrounds of each layer

Examples:
